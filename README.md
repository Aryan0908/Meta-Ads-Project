## üîπ Overview
I built an end-to-end analytics pipeline on a Meta Ads dataset (Campaigns ‚Üí Adsets ‚Üí Ads ‚Üí Daily Performance) to identify wasted spend, diagnose funnel drop-offs, and model ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù budget scenarios ‚Äî using **SQL** (KPIs + anomalies) and **Power BI/DAX** (rolling metrics, metric selector, scenario planning, custom tooltips, and drillthrough).

---

## üîπ Why this project?
- Turn raw ad logs into **business KPIs** (CTR, CPC, CPM, ROAS, CPL).
- Quantify **customer drop-offs** at every stage (Impression ‚Üí Click ‚Üí View Content ‚Üí Add-to-Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Purchase).
- Build a **What-if Analysis** layer to simulate spend, CTR, CVR and AOV changes.

> üí° Tip for reviewers: explore screenshots below, then skim the deep dives for the engineering behind them.

## üîπ Data & Model
**Tables**
- Campaigns: campaign_id, objective, buying_type, budget_type, budgets, dates
- Adsets: adset_id, campaign_id, age_group, gender, placement, device, country, budgets, dates
- Ads: ad_id, adset_id, ad_format, headline, call_to_action, video_length_sec
- Performance: ad_id, date, reach, impressions, clicks, cost, revenue, form_view, add_to_cart, initiate_checkout, purchases
- Date (Power BI) linked to Performance[date]

**Relationships:** Campaigns (1) ‚Üí Adsets (‚àû) ‚Üí Ads (‚àû) ‚Üí Performance (‚àû)

## üîπ Dashboard Pages
*(Add screenshots from your repo's images folder)*

- Main Dashboard
- Conversion  
- Conversion Details  
- Adset Analysis  
- Creative Analysis  
- What-if Analysis (Page 1)  
- What-if Analysis (Page 2)  

---

## üîπ Custom Tooltips & Drillthrough
- **Custom tooltips**: dedicated tooltip pages show contextual KPIs when hovering KPI cards/points.
- **Drillthrough**: right-click on a campaign/adset to open its detail page with context filters carried over.
- **Navigation**: back buttons and ‚ÄúPage Navigation‚Äù slicers streamline movement across pages.

## üîπ Deep Dives ‚Äî SQL

### 1) Rolling 7-day ROAS Change
- **üëâ Why**: Daily ROAS fluctuates a lot due to many factors. A 7-day rolling window smooths this volatility and shows whether ROI is improving or dropping week over week.

```sql
WITH daily AS (
  SELECT
    c.campaign_id,
    p.date,
    SUM(p.revenue) AS day_revenue,
    SUM(p.cost) AS day_cost
  FROM performance p
  JOIN ads a ON a.ad_id = p.ad_id
  JOIN adsets s ON s.adset_id = a.adset_id
  JOIN campaigns c ON c.campaign_id = s.campaign_id
  WHERE c.objective IN ('conversions','traffic')
  GROUP BY c.campaign_id, p.date
),
rolling AS (
  SELECT
    campaign_id,
    date,
    SUM(day_revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rev_7d,
    SUM(day_cost) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cost_7d
  FROM daily
),
roas AS (
  SELECT
    campaign_id,
    date,
    CASE WHEN cost_7d = 0 THEN NULL ELSE rev_7d / cost_7d END AS roas_7d
  FROM rolling
),
final AS (
  SELECT
    campaign_id,
    date,
    roas_7d,
    LAG(roas_7d, 7) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY date) AS prev_roas_7d,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY date DESC) AS rn
  FROM roas
)
SELECT
  campaign_id,
  date,
  ROUND(roas_7d, 2) AS current_week_roas,
  ROUND(prev_roas_7d, 2) AS prev_week_roas,
  ROUND( (roas_7d - prev_roas_7d) / NULLIF(prev_roas_7d, 0) * 100, 2) AS seven_day_roas_change
FROM final
WHERE rn = 1
  AND prev_roas_7d IS NOT NULL;
```
</details>

- **üëâ How**:
  1. ***Build Daily Totals***:
	 - Aggregate spend and revenue by campaign/date (daily CTE).
  2. ***Apply rolling window***: 
     - Use SUM(...) OVER (ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) from (daily CTE) to calculate 7-day spend and revenue (rolling CTE).
  3. ***Calculate ROAS***: 
     - Divide 7-day rolling revenue / 7-day rolling cost (roas CTE).
  4. ***Compare to prior week***: 
     - Use LAG(roas_7d, 7) to fetch ROAS from the previous 7-day period (final CTE).
  5. ***Final output***: 
     - Current vs previous ROAS side by side, plus % change.

- **‚úÖ Business value**: Helps marketers avoid overreacting to noisy daily ROAS and instead make budget decisions based on sustained week-over-week performance.
> üí° Note for reviewers: This query is specifically designed for campaigns with conversion and traffic campaigns.

### 2) CPC anomaly detection (z-score)
- **üëâ Why**: Occasionally CPC spikes due to auction competition, audience saturation, or poor targeting. Detecting anomalies quickly prevents wasted spend.

<summary>View SQL Code</summary>

```sql
WITH standarad_dev AS (
	SELECT
		s.adset_id,
		p.date,
		ROUND(((p.cpc - AVG(p.cpc) OVER (PARTITION BY s.adset_id))/STDDEV(p.cpc) OVER (PARTITION BY s.adset_id)),2) AS z_score

	FROM performance p
	JOIN ads a
		ON a.ad_id = p.ad_id
	JOIN adsets s
		ON s.adset_id = a.adset_id
	JOIN campaigns c
		ON c.campaign_id = s.campaign_id
),
overspend AS (
	SELECT
		s.adset_id,
		p.date,
		s.daily_budget,
		SUM(p.cost) AS daily_cost,
		ROUND(((SUM(p.cost)-s.daily_budget)/s.daily_budget)*100,2) AS overspend_perc
	FROM performance p
	JOIN ads a
		ON a.ad_id = p.ad_id
	JOIN adsets s
		ON s.adset_id = a.adset_id
	JOIN campaigns c
		ON c.campaign_id = s.campaign_id
	GROUP BY 
		s.adset_id,
		p.date,
		s.daily_budget
)
SELECT 
		stdev.adset_id,
		stdev.date,
		stdev.z_score,
		os.daily_budget,
		os.daily_cost,
		os.overspend_perc,
	CASE
		WHEN stdev.z_score >= 2 AND os.overspend_perc > 0 THEN 'Critical: High CPC + Overspend'
		WHEN stdev.z_score < 2 AND os.overspend_perc > 0 THEN 'Check: CPC Normal - Overspend'
		WHEN stdev.z_score >= 2 AND os.overspend_perc <= 0 THEN 'Check: CPC High - No Overspend'
		ELSE 'Everything is Fine!!'
	END AS alert
FROM standarad_dev AS stdev
JOIN overspend os
	ON os.adset_id = stdev.adset_id AND os.date = stdev.date
WHERE
	z_score > 2
ORDER BY adset_id, date
```
</details>

- **üëâ How**:
  1. ***Calculate z-scores***: 
	- For each adset/day, compute z_score = (cpc - mean) / stddev (standarad_dev CTE).
  2. ***Check overspend***: 
	- Compare actual spend vs assigned budget and compute overspend % (overspend CTE).
  3. ***Combine results***: 
	- Join CPC anomalies with overspend data.
  4. ***Flag severity***:
	- Use a CASE expression to tag:
		- Critical: High CPC + Overspend
		- Check: CPC Normal + Overspend
		- Check: CPC High + No Overspend
		- Everything is Fine

- **‚úÖ Business value**: Detecting when the anomaly occured and it's z-score and detect the most probable cause i.e. overspend.

### 3) Campaign funnel drop-offs & stage rates
- **üëâ Why**: Not all campaigns fail at the same stage ‚Äî some lose clicks at the landing page, others lose buyers at checkout. This query highlights where users drop out of the funnel.
<details>
<summary><b>View SQL code</b></summary>

```sql
With default_table AS (
SELECT
	c.campaign_id,
	SUM(p.view_content) AS view_content,
	SUM(p.add_to_cart) AS add_to_cart,
	SUM(p.initiate_checkout) AS initiate_checkout,
	SUM(p.purchase) AS purchase
FROM performance p
JOIN ads a ON a.ad_id = p.ad_id
JOIN adsets s ON s.adset_id = a.adset_id
JOIN campaigns c ON c.campaign_id = s.campaign_id
WHERE
	c.objective = 'conversions'
GROUP BY c.campaign_id
),
view_content_tbl AS (
SELECT
	campaign_id,
	'View Content' AS conversion_event,
	COALESCE(view_content,0) AS total_events,
	1 AS stager
FROM default_table
),
atc_tbl AS (
SELECT
	campaign_id,
	'Add To Cart' AS conversion_event,
	COALESCE(add_to_cart,0) AS total_events,
	2 AS stager
FROM default_table
),
initiate_checkout_tbl AS (
SELECT
	campaign_id,
	'Initiate Checkout' AS conversion_event,
	COALESCE(initiate_checkout,0) AS total_events,
	3 AS stager
FROM default_table
),
purchase_tbl AS (
SELECT
	campaign_id,
	'Purchase' AS conversion_event,
	COALESCE(purchase,0) AS total_events,
	4 AS stager
FROM default_table
),
new_tbl AS (
SELECT campaign_id, conversion_event, total_events, 
COALESCE(
	LAG(total_events) OVER (PARTITION BY campaign_id ORDER BY stager ASC),
	0) AS lag_col 
FROM
(SELECT * FROM view_content_tbl
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM atc_tbl
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM initiate_checkout_tbl
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM purchase_tbl
ORDER BY campaign_id DESC, stager ASC)
)

SELECT 
	campaign_id,
	conversion_event,
	total_events,
	CASE
	     WHEN lag_col = 0 THEN 0
	     ELSE ROUND(((lag_col - total_events)*100.00/lag_col),2)
	END AS drop_off_rate_percnt

FROM new_tbl
```
</details>

- **üëâ How**:
  1. ***Build campaign-level totals***:
	- default_table: Join Performance ‚Üí Ads ‚Üí Adsets ‚Üí Campaigns
    - Filter to objective = conversions
	- Aggregate view_content, add_to_cart, initiate_checkout, purchase
  2. ***Unpivot into stage tables***:
    - view_content_tbl, atc_tbl, initiate_checkout_tbl, purchase_tbl
	- Convert wide totals ‚Üí long format with (campaign, stage, total_events)
	- Attach a stage order: 1=View Content ‚Üí 2=ATC ‚Üí 3=Checkout ‚Üí 4=Purchase
  3. ***Union and compute previous stage***:
	- new_tbl: UNION ALL stage tables
	- Use LAG(total_events) to fetch previous stage total per campaign
	- Guard with COALESCE() for the first stage
  4. ***Final output***:
	- drop_off_rate_percnt = (prev - current)/prev * 100
	- Returns one row per (campaign, stage) showing % loss at that step

- **‚úÖ Business value**: This explains where company is loosing it's customers. For eg.
	- Large drop from ‚ÄúAdd To Cart ‚Üí Checkout‚Äù = pricing or shipping issue
	- High ‚ÄúView Content‚Äù but low ‚ÄúAdd To Cart‚Äù = weak product relevance or creatives
This helps marketers pinpoint the weakest funnel stage and fix it first.

## üîπ Deep Dives ‚Äî DAX
### Best Week (by ROAS)
- **üëâ Why**: Surface the single strongest week to highlight peak performance in the period
<details>
<summary><b>View DAX code</b></summary>

```DAX
BestWeek =
CALCULATE(
    MAX('Date'[WeekNum]),
    TOPN(
        1,
        ADDCOLUMNS(
            SUMMARIZE('Date', 'Date'[WeekNum]),
            "Weekly ROAS", [Roas]
        ),
        [Weekly ROAS], DESC
    )
)
```
</details>

- **üëâ How**: Ranks weeks by [Roas] and returns the week with the highest value

### Rolling ROAS (7 days)
- **üëâ Why**: To keep up ROAS fluctuations and trends
<details>
<summary><b>View DAX code</b></summary>

```DAX
7DaysRollingRoas =
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD('Date'[Date], MAX('Date'[Date]), -7, DAY),
    [Roas]
)
```
</details>

- **üëâ How**: Averages daily [Roas] across the last 7 days.

### ROAS Month-over-Month
- **üëâ Why**: Track ROAS trend month over month with explicit date windows
<details>
<summary><b>View DAX code</b></summary>

```DAX
RoasCurrentMonth =
VAR maxMonth = MAX('Date'[MonthNum])
RETURN
    CALCULATE(
        [Roas],
        MONTH(performance[date]) = maxMonth
    )

RoasPreviousMonth =
VAR startPrevMonth = EOMONTH(MAX('Date'[Date]), -2) + 1
VAR endPrevMonth   = EOMONTH(MAX('Date'[Date]), -1)
RETURN
    CALCULATE(
        IF ( [Roas] > 0, [Roas], 0 ),
        'Date'[Date] >= startPrevMonth && 'Date'[Date] <= endPrevMonth
    )

Roas_MOM% =
VAR prev = [RoasPreviousMonth]
VAR curr = [RoasCurrentMonth]
RETURN IF ( NOT ISBLANK(prev), DIVIDE(curr - prev, prev) )

Roas_MOMLabel =
VAR change = [Roas_MOM%] * 100
RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        ISBLANK(change), "‚Äì",
        change > 0, "‚ñ≤ " & FORMAT(change, "0.0") & "% MoM",
        change < 0, "‚ñº " & FORMAT(change, "0.0") & "% MoM",
        "0.0% MoM"
    )
```
</details>

- **üëâ How**:
	1. ***Current month***: Uses MAX('Date'[MonthNum]) to select the active month
	2. ***Previous month***: calculates start/end boundaries with EOMONTH

### Metric Selector + Dynamic Title
- **üëâ Why**: One visual toggles CTR/CPC/ROAS/CPL
<details>
<summary><b>View DAX code</b></summary>

```DAX
  Selected Metric Value =
VAR m = SELECTEDVALUE ( MetricSelector[Metric], "ROAS" )
RETURN
    SWITCH (
        TRUE (),
        m = "CTR",  DIVIDE ( [Clicks],   [Impressions] ),
        m = "CPC",  DIVIDE ( [Cost],     [Clicks]     ),
        m = "ROAS", DIVIDE ( [Revenue],  [Cost]       ),
        m = "CPL",  DIVIDE ( [Cost],     [Purchases]  )
    )

Dynamic Title = "Performance by " & SELECTEDVALUE ( MetricSelector[Metric], "ROAS" )
```
</details>
