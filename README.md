<h1>Meta Ads Performance Analysis: SQL + Power BI</h1>
<h6>I built an end-to-end analytics pipeline on a Meta Ads dataset (Campaigns → Adsets → Ads → Daily Performance) to identify wasted spend, diagnose funnel drop-offs, and model “what-if” budget scenarios — using SQL (KPIs + anomalies) and Power BI/DAX (visual representation, rolling metrics, metric switcher, scenario planning)</h6>

  <h2>Why this project?</h2>
  <h6>Companies spend heavily on ads but struggle to see where budget is wasted and which levers move ROAS. I designed this project to:</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Turn raw ad logs into business KPIs (CTR, CPC, CPM, ROAS, CPL).</li>
    <li>Learn customer drop-offs at every stage (Form View/Landing Page View -> Add-to-Cart -> Initiate Checkout -> Conversion/Purchase)</li>
    <li>This project helps me build What-if Analysis Dashboard</li>
  </ul>
